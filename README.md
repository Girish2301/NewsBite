## 📌 1️⃣ Problem Statement

In the digital age, readers face information overload from countless news sources. Manually scanning lengthy articles is inefficient and impractical.

**✅ Solution:** Build an intelligent system that can automatically fetch live news articles, summarize them using an AI model, and display them to users through a clean web interface.
